## IDEA
Diving for treasure:
- the player is a diver and has to collect items from underwater
- only when pressing the downward arrow they will stay underwater, otherwise float upwards
- the game is won by finding all items within the time (30 secs of air per dive)
- arrow keys are used for navigation
- items are collected by collision
